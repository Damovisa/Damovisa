# Hi, I'm Damian 👋
_[He/Him/His]_

I'm a Staff Developer Advocate 🥑 at [GitHub](https://github.com) and specialize in DevOps and MLOps.

After spending a year in Toronto 🍁, I returned to Australia 🦘 in 2018, and currently live in Brisbane.

Before GitHub, I spent 4 years as a Cloud Advocate at [Microsoft](https://azure.com) on the DevOps team. Before that I was a dev at [Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com) 🐙 and a Microsoft MVP 🏅. Before that, well... I've been a developer for 25+ years in a broad range of industries. In Australia, I've organized events and meetups, currently co-hosting the [Brisbane GitHub User Group], and I launched the now annual [DDD Brisbane](https://dddbrisbane.com) conference. I regularly speak at conferences, User Groups, and other events around the world 🌏.

Most of the time you'll find me talking to software engineers, IT pros and managers to help them get the most out of their DevOps strategies.

You can find me on Twitter at [@damovisa](https://twitter.com/damovisa) and Mastodon at <a rel="me" href="https://hachyderm.io/@damovisa">hachyderm.io/@damovisa</a>.
