# Hi, I'm Damian 👋
_[He/Him]_

I'm a Developer Advocate ☁🥑 at [GitHub](https://github.com) specializing in DevOps and MLOps.

After spending a year in Toronto 🍁, I returned to Australia 🦘 in 2018, and currently live in Brisbane.

Before GitHub, I spent 4 years as a Cloud Advocate at [Microsoft](https://azure.com) on the DevOps team. Before that I was a dev at [Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com) 🐙 and a Microsoft MVP 🏅. Before that, well... I've been a developer for 20+ years in a broad range of industries. In Australia, I co-organised the Brisbane .Net User Group, and launched the now annual [DDD Brisbane](https://dddbrisbane.com) conference. I regularly speak at conferences, User Groups, and other events around the world 🌏 although these days it's via a camera and mic 📹🎙.

Most of the time you'll find me talking to software engineers, IT pros and managers to help them get the most out of their DevOps strategies.
